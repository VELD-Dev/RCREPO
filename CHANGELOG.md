- First release ! Contains:
	- Crates: Very resistant to hits. Midly valuable.
	- Indestructible Crates: Unbreakable crates. Highly valuable.
	- Explosive Crates: Very sensible to hits. Very highly valuable.
	- Azimuth Pocket Watch: Very fragile. Highly valuable.
	- OmniWrench 3000: Unbreakable. For now it can only be found. It is bugged.
	- All the crates have the original games' sound effects when broken, hit or destroyed. Same for the OmniWrench.
- Planned:
	- Crates can only be destroyed by Wrenches.
	- Indestructible Crates can only be destroyed by explosives (e.g. Explosive Crates, Grenades, etc...).
	- Explosive Crates may explode when a player or an enemy touches them, with the iconic countdown sound of explosive crates.
	- All the crates will drop bolts when destroyed that are as valuable/more valuable than the crate itself.
	- Nanotech Crates will be breakable easily with any melee weapon, will not drop bolts when destroyed but will drop a nanotech orb that regens 100hp.
	- More wrenches will be added, with different properties, different damages and different values.
	- If requested, wrenches will not spawn in maps anymore but instead will spawn in the shop.
	- If requested, a separate currency can be added using the bolts that will be picked up by players by breaking crates and killing enemies. This currency may be converted to money in order to help fulfill a quota.
	- In a far future, a new dungeon will be added: Aquatos Sewers from Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, with Ratchet & Clank-only valuables.
