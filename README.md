Add Ratchet & Clank stuff to REPO as valuables, items and maps !

## Features

### Crates

The iconic crates from Ratchet & Clank have been added to REPO as valuables.
- **Wooden Crates**: Quite resistant, midly valuable (3000-7000$)
- **Indestructible Crates**: Unbreakable, highly valuable (5000-9000$)
- **Explosive Crates**: Very sensible to hits, very highly valuable (7500-11500$)

### Wrenches

The famous OmniWrench weapons have been added to REPO as a valuable that acts as a melee weapon. For now it can only be found, not bought. (It is also bugged)
- **OmniWrench 3000**: Unbreakable, highly valuable (5000-7500$), deals medium damage. (Quite glitchy for now)

### Miscellaneous

I have also added various items from Ratchet & Clank as valuables:
- **Azimuth Pocket Watch**: Very fragile, highly valuable (10000-12500$)
